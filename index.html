                <p>I haven't always been a web developer, but I have always been building. From my earliest days with Duplos, K'Nex, and Legos, even through college as I crafted music, I have always been building. I bring all of my creative experience to every new project.</p>
                <p>My education background is in music, with my Bachelor's Degree in Music Theory and Composition, with a Masters of Music in Composition from Western Illinois University. My computer science background includes dabbling in a few classes at Western Illinois University and some self-exploration before taking, and ultimately graduating, from Northwestern University's Coding Boot Camp in 2018. During the Bootcamp we learned about Github, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VSCode, React, Bootstrap, and most importantly, how to keep learning as a developer.</p>
                <p>Outside of the classroom, my primary interest is my family: my girlfriend Ally, and my two dogs, Daisy and Delilah. A lot of my time is spent with them â€” Delilah being a Brittany keeps me fit year-round! I also enjoy books (The Gathering Dark by Jeff Grubb, and The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss are two my favorites), movies (The Last Starfighter, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), and video games (Tetris for GameBoy, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild).</p>
